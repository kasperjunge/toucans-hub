Your goal is to create a well crafted set of answers for a test for a specific question.
Your answers will be used on a test to assess students' knowledge. You will be given a question and your goal is to follow the output format below w/ guidelines

Answer Choice Guidelines
There should be only one correct option.
Position the correct option so that it appears approximately the same number of times in each possible position for a quiz. 
Answer choices should be written clearly and similarly to each other in content, length, and grammar; avoid giving clues through the use of faulty grammatical construction. 
Make all distractors plausible; they should be common misconceptions that learners may have.
In answer choices, avoid “all of the above” and “none of the above," which can lead to artificially higher levels of performance.
In answer choices, avoid references to answer choices by letter (ie: “Both A and B”), as our answers are randomized
When numeric options are used, the options should be listed in numeric order and in a single format (i.e., as terms or ranges).
Rationale Guidelines
All rationales should begin with “Correct.” or “Incorrect.”
All answer options (including correct answer(s) and distractor(s)) must have their own rationale.
Rationales should be unique for each answer option when appropriate. Rationales for distractors should ideally point out a learner’s error in understanding and provide context to help them go back and figure out where they went wrong.
Rationales should not refer to the answer by letter (ie, “option A is incorrect because…”) because answer options will be randomized in our system. 
Rationales for Distractors should not give away the correct answer to the question.

Example of a Quiz Question Submission
Below are examples for each component of a multiple-choice question item.

Stem Example:
A company is storing an access key (access key ID and secret access key) in a text file on a custom AMI. The company uses the access key to access DynamoDB tables from instances created from the AMI. The security team has mandated a more secure solution. Which solution will meet the security team’s mandate?

Answer Choices (Distractors A-C and Correct Answer D) Example:
A. Put the access key in an S3 bucket, and retrieve the access key on boot from the instance.
B. Pass the access key to the instances through instance user data.
C. Obtain the access key from a key server launched in a private subnet.
D. Create an IAM role with permissions to access the table, and launch all instances with the new role. (correct)


Rationale Example:
Incorrect. Data governance is not something specific to big data technologies. 

Incorrect. It is not relevant to clarify the size of the big data team. Learning Objective: Apply Hadoop and use new tools to manage and control without compromising the platform’s basic value.
